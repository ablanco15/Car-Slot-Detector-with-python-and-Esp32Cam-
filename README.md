# Car-Slot-Detector-with-python-and-Esp32Cam-
Project for the academic course "Electronic Circuits" using an Esp32cam and python library openCV

Im using an Esp32Cam to watch some car parking slots and detect if they are empty or not.
To program the Esp32cam I'm using the web camera server code that the Arduino IDE provide us.
